**Time Spent**: ~2 hours  
**Status**: Ahead of schedule

### Tuesday, August 5 (2 hours)

**Focus**: File Upload Integration

- [ ] Complete Firebase Storage integration
- [ ] Fix file upload to actually save to Storage
- [ ] Generate secure download URLs
- [ ] Add file metadata to Firestore

**Deliverable**: Files uploading to Firebase Storage

**üìã Tomorrow's Detailed Plan**:

**Phase 1: Storage Integration (45 min)**

1. Update Firebase Storage rules for authenticated users
2. Create `src/services/storage.service.ts` with upload/download functions
3. Test storage rules with Firebase emulators

**Phase 2: Upload Implementation (45 min)**  
4. Modify DragDropSection to actually upload files to Firebase Storage
5. Add user choice: "Save files to account" vs "Temporary processing only"
6. Add upload progress indicators
7. Handle upload errors gracefully

**Phase 3: Storage Logic & URLs (30 min)**
8. Implement dual storage paths: `files/{userId}/` (permanent) vs `temp/{sessionId}/` (auto-delete)
9. Create Firestore document only for saved files
10. Generate secure download URLs for both storage types
11. Test both storage options end-to-end

**Prerequisites**:

- Firebase emulators running (`firebase emulators:start`)
- Review current drag-drop UI implementation
- Check existing Firebase config in `src/config/firebase.config.ts`

**üéØ Tomorrow's Summary**: Transform the existing drag-and-drop UI from a mockup into a fully functional file upload system with **user-controlled storage options**. Users can choose between saving files to their account permanently or using temporary processing-only storage that auto-deletes. This bridges the gap between UI and backend functionality while respecting user privacy preferences.

## üìã Technical Details

### User-Controlled Storage Architecture

**Storage Options UI**:

```typescript
interface StoragePreference {
  saveToAccount: boolean; // true = permanent, false = temporary
  autoDelete?: number;    // hours for temp files (default: 1)
}
```

**Storage Paths**:

```
// Permanent storage (user chooses to save)
files/
  {userId}/
    {fileId}/
      original.pdf
      converted.docx

// Temporary storage (auto-delete)  
temp/
  {sessionId}/
    {timestamp}-original.pdf    // Delete after 1 hour
    {timestamp}-converted.docx  // Delete after 1 hour
```

**Auto-Cleanup Function**:

```typescript
export const cleanupTempFiles = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('every 30 minutes')
  .onRun(async () => {
    // Delete temp files older than 1 hour
    const cutoff = Date.now() - (60 * 60 * 1000);
    // Cleanup logic...
  });
```

### Firebase Functions Setup

```bash
# Initialize Functions
firebase init functions

# Choose TypeScript
# Install dependencies
cd functions && npm install

# Add conversion libraries
npm install pdf-parse mammoth sharp
```

### File Conversion Architecture

```typescript
// functions/src/conversions/pdfToDocx.ts
import * as functions from 'firebase-functions';
import * as admin from 'firebase-admin';

export const convertPdfToDocx = functions.storage
  .object()
  .onFinalize(async (object) => {
    if (!object.name?.includes('uploads/')) return;
    
    // Download file
    // Convert PDF to DOCX
    // Upload converted file
    // Update Firestore
  });
```

### Firestore Collections

```
users/
  {userId}/
    conversions/
      {conversionId}
        - fileName
        - fileSize
        - inputFormat
        - outputFormat  
        - status
        - createdAt
        - completedAt
        - downloadUrl
```
