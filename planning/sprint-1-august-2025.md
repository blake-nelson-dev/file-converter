## üìã Technical Details

### Firebase Functions Setup

```bash
# Initialize Functions
firebase init functions

# Choose TypeScript
# Install dependencies
cd functions && npm install

# Add conversion libraries
npm install pdf-parse mammoth sharp
```

### File Conversion Architecture

```typescript
// functions/src/conversions/pdfToDocx.ts
import * as functions from 'firebase-functions';
import * as admin from 'firebase-admin';

export const convertPdfToDocx = functions.storage
  .object()
  .onFinalize(async (object) => {
    if (!object.name?.includes('uploads/')) return;
    
    // Download file
    // Convert PDF to DOCX
    // Upload converted file
    // Update Firestore
  });
```

### Firestore Collections

```
users/
  {userId}/
    conversions/
      {conversionId}
        - fileName
        - fileSize
        - inputFormat
        - outputFormat  
        - status
        - createdAt
        - completedAt
        - downloadUrl
```

## üéØ Success Metrics

   - Solution: Set 10MB limit initially
   - Future: Implement chunked uploads

3. **Function cold starts**
   - Solution: Keep functions warm
   - Future: Optimize bundle size

### Time Management

- If behind: Focus on PDF‚ÜíDOCX only
- If ahead: Add more conversion types
- Daily check-ins to adjust scope

## üìù Daily Standup Format
