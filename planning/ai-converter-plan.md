# AI-Enhanced File Conversion Platform: Flexible Development Plan

**Document Created**: July 30, 2025  
**Project Timeline**: 6 months (August 2025 - January 2026)  
**Weekly Commitment**: 10-20 hours

## Executive Summary
This plan uses modern 2025 agile practices adapted for part-time development (10-20 hrs/week). It emphasizes **adaptive planning**, **iterative development**, and **milestone-based progress** rather than rigid timelines.

---

## 🎯 Development Philosophy for 2025

### Core Principles (Based on Current Best Practices)
1. **Iterative Development**: Break projects into small, manageable sprints that deliver continuous value
2. **Flexibility First**: Use agile methods to adjust priorities based on feedback and changing requirements
3. **Lightweight Planning**: Do more frequent, lighter planning rather than heavy upfront planning
4. **Time-boxed Work**: Fixed time periods with variable scope (not fixed scope with variable time)

## 📈 Adaptive Planning Techniques

### Sprint Velocity Tracking
```javascript
// Track your actual velocity to improve estimates
const sprintMetrics = {
  sprint1: { planned: 20, actual: 16, completed: 80% },
  sprint2: { planned: 18, actual: 18, completed: 100% },
  // Adjust future sprints based on history
  averageVelocity: 17 // hours of productive work per sprint
};
```

### Weekly Time Boxing
```yaml
Monday (2 hrs):
  - Code review & planning
  - Start new feature

Tuesday (2 hrs):
  - Deep work on feature
  - No meetings

Wednesday (2 hrs):
  - Continue feature work
  - Quick testing

Thursday (2 hrs):
  - Bug fixes

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Daily Rhythm (Part-Time Optimized)
```typescript
interface DailyWorkflow {
  startup: {
    duration: "15 min",
    tasks: ["Check metrics", "Review yesterday", "Set today's goal"]
  },
  
  deepWork: {
    duration: "1-2 hours",
    tasks: ["Single feature focus", "No context switching"]
  },
  
  wrapup: {
    duration: "15 min",
    tasks: ["Commit code", "Update task board", "Note blockers"]
  }
}
```

### Modern Development Practices

#### 1. Continuous Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions for automated testing
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Deploy to Firebase Preview
        if: github.ref != 'refs/heads/main'
        run: |
          npm run build
          firebase hosting:channel:deploy preview-${{ github.sha }}
```

#### 2. Feature Flags with Firebase Remote Config
```javascript
// Use Firebase Remote Config for feature flags
import { getRemoteConfig, getValue } from 'firebase/remote-config';

const remoteConfig = getRemoteConfig();
remoteConfig.defaultConfig = {
  ai_ocr_enabled: false,
  batch_processing_enabled: false,
  api_enabled: false
};

// Check feature availability
const aiOcrEnabled = getValue(remoteConfig, 'ai_ocr_enabled').asBoolean();
if (aiOcrEnabled && user.tier === 'pro') {
  enableAiOcr();
}
```
