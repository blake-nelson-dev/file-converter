## 📋 Technical Details

### User-Controlled Storage Architecture

**Storage Options UI**:

```typescript
interface StoragePreference {
  saveToAccount: boolean; // true = permanent, false = temporary
  autoDelete?: number;    // hours for temp files (default: 1)
}
```

**Storage Paths**:

```
// Permanent storage (user chooses to save)
files/
  {userId}/
    {fileId}/
      original.pdf
      converted.docx

// Temporary storage (auto-delete)  
temp/
  {sessionId}/
    {timestamp}-original.pdf    // Delete after 1 hour
    {timestamp}-converted.docx  // Delete after 1 hour
```

**Auto-Cleanup Function**:

```typescript
export const cleanupTempFiles = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('every 30 minutes')
  .onRun(async () => {
    // Delete temp files older than 1 hour
    const cutoff = Date.now() - (60 * 60 * 1000);
    // Cleanup logic...
  });
```

### Firebase Functions Setup

```bash
# Initialize Functions
firebase init functions

# Choose TypeScript
# Install dependencies
cd functions && npm install

# Add conversion libraries
npm install pdf-parse mammoth sharp
```

### File Conversion Architecture

```typescript
// functions/src/conversions/pdfToDocx.ts
import * as functions from 'firebase-functions';
import * as admin from 'firebase-admin';

export const convertPdfToDocx = functions.storage
  .object()
  .onFinalize(async (object) => {
    if (!object.name?.includes('uploads/')) return;
    
    // Download file
    // Convert PDF to DOCX
    // Upload converted file
    // Update Firestore
  });
```

### Firestore Collections

```
users/
  {userId}/
    conversions/
      {conversionId}
        - fileName
        - fileSize
        - inputFormat
        - outputFormat  
        - status
        - createdAt
        - completedAt
        - downloadUrl
```
